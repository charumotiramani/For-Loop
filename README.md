# For-loop
A for loop is a repetition control structure that allows you to efficiently write a loop that needs to execute a specific number of times.

### Syntax:  
for ( init; condition; increment ) { statement(s); }

### Working of for loop  
1.The initialization statement is executed only once.  
2.Then, the test expression is evaluated. If the test expression is evaluated to false, the for loop is terminated.  
3.However, if the test expression is evaluated to true, statements inside the body of the for loop are executed, and the update expression is updated.Again the test expression is evaluated.  
4.This process goes on until the test expression is false. When the test expression is false, the loop terminates.
