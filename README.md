# For-loop
A for loop is a repetition control structure that allows you to efficiently write a loop that needs to execute a specific number of times.

### Syntax:  
for ( init; condition; increment ) { statement(s); }

1:-The init step is executed first, and only once. declaration and initialization of any loop control variables. 2:-Next, the condition is evaluated. If it is true, the body of the loop is executed. If it is false, the body of the loop does not execute and the flow of control jumps to the next statement just after the 'for' loop. 3:- the flow of control jumps back up to the increment statement. This statement increments loop control variables.

The condition is now evaluated again. If true, the loop executes and the process repeats itself (body of loop, then increment step again) After the condition becomes false, the 'for' loop terminates.
